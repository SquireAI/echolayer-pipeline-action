# Using EchoLayer GitHub Action

## Adding the Action to your Workflow

The EchoLayer GitHub Component Discovery action is available to you inside your existing workflows. You can add it to any workflow you want to use it in. Hereâ€™s an example of a workflow that will run the action on every push to the main branch of your repository:

```
name: Sync EchoLayer

on: [merge_group, workflow_dispatch, push]

jobs:
  echolayer_pipeline:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    name: Sync
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Sync Backstage Catalog
        uses: echolayer/echolayer-pipeline-action@HEAD
        with:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          apiPath: "https://api.echolayer.com/api"
          apiKey: ${{ secrets.ECHOLAYER_API_KEY }}
```

### Environment Variables

This environment variable is provided by GitHub and is required for the action to run. You can read more about it [here](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/authentication-in-a-workflow#about-the-github_token-secret).

#### `apiPath`

This environment variable calls for the API path for your EchoLayer instance. This is a required variable. If you are using the hosted version of EchoLayer, you can use the value `https://api.echolayer.com/api`.

#### `apiKey`

This environment variable calls for your EchoLayer API key which you can obtain by following the steps below. This is a required variable.
